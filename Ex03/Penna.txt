PENNA MODEL :

Concepts :
	- Individuals from different species aging
	- Aging is controlled by a genome which can suffer some mutations
	- Some mechanisms for birth and death exist

All individuals from the same species share the parameters of the mechanism for birth and death :
	- B : the genome size
	- T : threshold of disease before dying
	- Nmax : the max allowed population
	- M : the mutation rate
	- R : the minimum age of reproduction
	- all the mechanisms in which these parameters contribute

Each individual should have for its own :
	- an age
	- a genome

For representation, I would have each individual being a instance of a class, with attributes Age and Genome.
All the parameters for birth and death should be class parameters
Birth and Death mechanisms should also be class functions.
