I see that you put quite some thought and effort into it :)

The main points that probably mess up your measurements:

std::function is as slow as OO, since it uses the same techniques inside
-> use native function pointers

I like your factory pattern, just don't forget to make the dtor virtual in the base


to see only the comments (also later on), you can use:
git pull --tags     // will make sure that you get the tags from the server
git checkout ex8    // go back to my commit
git diff HEAD~3     // compare it with your commit (my commit - 3)
git checkout master // this brings you back to the future
