Make: nicely done, even with install

PI: the main-code should be in a function

Distr: looks ok, remove inefficient section (maybe later make also buffered)

to see only the comments (also later on), you can use:
git pull --tags     // will make sure that you get the tags from the server
git checkout ex13   // go back to my commit
git diff HEAD~1     // compare it with your commit (my commit - 1)
git checkout master // this brings you back to the future
